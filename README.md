ML Classification Models

This repository contains basic machine learning and neural network models implemented as part of coursework.

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)
- Artificial Neural Network – Binary Classification
- Artificial Neural Network – Multiclass Classification (Iris dataset)

## Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

## Objective
To understand and compare traditional ML models with neural networks for classification tasks.

## Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
Used for binary classification (Benign vs Malignant).

Iris Dataset
Used for multiclass classification (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
